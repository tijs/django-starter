## Django Starter Project

This project shows the basic setup for most of [our](http://automatique.nl) Django projects. We are bound to have
dependencies that you do not have since you use different tools. So don't blindly copy this is i guess what
i am saying. If you take a peek at the requirements.txt you'll get a good sense of the sort of things we use
a lot.

Feel free to tell me what i'm doing wrong! Also, if you do end up using this template i'd love to hear about it.
